/*
    What is the average number of births per day of the week across all years?
    Which day of the week has the highest number of births on average?
    How does the number of births vary by month of the year?
    Are there any months where the number of births is consistently higher or lower than average?
    How do the trends in births differ between weekdays and weekends?
